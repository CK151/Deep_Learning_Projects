# Mnist project
This project is conducted to classify numbers into the right classification from 0 to 9
### Data Source
[mnist Dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/mnist)

### About the dataset
The dataset contains a total of 70,000 images which are all black and white (grayscale) and has a shape of (28,28)

### Feature Scaling
I used a defined scale to scale the train and test datasets to place them between values of 0 and 1 which is normalisation the best form of data to feed tensorflow
#### Model
I built 3 models, started from a basic model and tried to improve as developed more models at the end the 2nd model was the best however i used the 3rd model because it has a simpler model architecture and a little difference from model 2

# Result visualisaton 🧪

I used a function to visualise the result using the confusion matrix and i noticed that the model was confusing 7 and 2 then i had to visualize the test data to know what is wrong and suprisingly i saw that some of the images look like 2 but was labeled 7.

***I hope you have fun going through the notebook 😇✊🏿, 🔑 please reach out to me if there is any improvements you will like to add.***
