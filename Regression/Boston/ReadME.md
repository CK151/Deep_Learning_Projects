# Boston House Price Prediction: TensorFlow Regression Problem
This project is conducted to predict house prices based on some features, the datasest is gotton from TensorFlow
### Data Source
[Boston Dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/datasets/boston_housing/load_data)

### About the dataset
The dataset contains 14 columns including the target variable.
The dataset has no missing values, so that is timed saved on preprosing.

### Feature Scaling
I used the MinMaxScaler for normalisation which is between 1 and -1 as it is the most prefered scale for tensorflow

#### Model
I built 4 models, started from a basic model and tried to improve as developed more models at the end the 4th model was the best

This is my first Deep Neural Network model  will improve my skills with time. Please let me know what you think 🫡 👨🏿‍💻
